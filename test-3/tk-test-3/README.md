## Ingredients
The app MUST use:
1. Bootstrap / [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) (Cerulean Theme)

The CDNs of all ingredients, along with `script.js` and `style.css` files, have already been linked in the `<head>`.

***Note*** The text for book has been taken from https://www.amazon.com/How-Stop-Worrying-Start-Living/dp/0671733354

## Rules
1. Your app should look like the mockups attached in the `screenshots` folder. Try to achieve pixel perfection.

3. The code should be refactored
4. You must upload the task to your Github Account and host it on Github Pages at 6 PM.
